I'm a server, I want to be able keep track of all my parties, place orders on my ipad, and produce a reciept for my customers at the end of a meal.

I'm a manager, I want to manage new server additions to the software, moniter my servers activities, and see some basic accounting information at the end of a night. I don't want my servers to have access to my monitoring information
